As a solution driven software engineer with over 8 years of experience in web & mobile development from architecture design to production deployment. From college, my career started with C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been growing rapidly, as a result I can make my store of knowledge and expertise perfectly and
strongly with lots of programming languages, frameworks, and experience of using toolkit and libraries. Also, Iâ€™ve worked on the various projects of many industries such as E-commerce, Financing, Betting, Real estate, and so on; it makes me enthusiastic and full of confident in any projects. I love learning anything, in particular
technologies from everyone, debating, and teaching what I get on. My hobbies are cooking and travelling. (However not much, only want in the future)
